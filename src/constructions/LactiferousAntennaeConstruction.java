/*
 * Technical outline:
 * 
 * Lactiferous Antennae--ee
 * 1/4
 * When Lactiferous Antennae is instantiated, your opponent exposes a random function from his function bag.  
 * It remains exposed until it leaves his function bag.  If that function leaves his function bag, your opponent
 * exposes a different function from his function bag at random.
 * Extraction: ggg
 * 
 * Creative outline:
 * 
 * A comparatively small pair or trio of antennae that are capable of biologically detecting
 * a small amount of indiscriminate information.  They have weak, but not minimal offensive capability.
 * They lactate significantly, making them valued primarily as a resource piece.
