-potential variants:
	Drafting:  Draft functions before the start of the match
	Dummy Fighting:  This seems like a very cool way to begin without much interactivity.  You know the contents and order of your function library and you simply have to reduce a dummy's Fault Tolerance to 0.

-move "interfaces" to "instance attributes"
	Could potentially have other types of interfaces.
